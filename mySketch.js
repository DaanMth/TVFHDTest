So the whole family movin, mom dad lil bro. Non of which I\u2019m close to. \n\nMy brother and i never actually close. We have our moments but not much. He often pissed at me when I show affection like head rub, hug, joke around. We were already like that before but after i went to study abroad for 5 yrs the gap between us grow even bigger. I came back last years around August.\n\n My mom lost her job because the house is her only business.( she had a restaurant ). She never understood me or even tryin to understand. \nAlways tell me to act like how she wanted. And also the one cause me the most traumas. \n\nMy father is i guess the least (heartless) he care very little about anything. Never said son you want to learn how to build a shelf or let me teach you how to drills and make clothes hanger. I get yelled every time he ask me to help. And its make me never want to ask him to show me anything. \n\nI started to regret my decision for not dying when i was abroad. And btw i was already thinking maybe i should just die in the Canadian wilderness instead of going back. Hang myself on some tree and call its a life. I was extremely depressed and overwhelmed. But I don\u2019t know what makes me come back. And with all this shit, Its make me contemplate about hanging myself or yeet myself off a high bridge even higher now. I just so fked right now, no girlfriend, no friends, noone. \n\nSometimes i even think why and what the fuck do i continue this for. I proudly claim I\u2019m Atheist to the core but i also into philosophical and Zen. Which contradicts my belief. All of my reading points towards life is a game. But why tf am i on survival mode. Because it\u2019s all a game if i yeet myself now i will just be transformed into some other shit and continued to suffer. Sometimes i wonder what the fuck the Buddha see when he get enlightened that make him laugh. I\u2019m here ballin my eyes out because non of what i want comes to fruition.",

    "text": "I know these types of posts are probably posted here every day but i just want to share my opinions on this because i need somewhere to vent. Im an 18 year old male and i never had a gf or had sex. Now you might say my age is still young and i will have ample opportunity in the future but i feel like that day will never come. \n\nI dont even know the exact reason as to why i never had any romantic or sexual interaction with girls. Most of my friends had at least one gf or bf. Most of my friends had sex at least once. When i think about me, i really dont know what is missing in my life that everyone else seems to magically have. \n\nI dont have any problem talking to women or befriending them. But i never flirted in my life for example. Not even once. I never tried to approach a women. I never tried to move things to the next level. I probably dont even know how to. My social skills about this topic are bad. I dont really know how to attract women and im not attractive to begin with. Im 5'6, im not athletic or fit (i would consider myself weak actually). I have a small frame and body. And i dont really exude any charisma or confidence. I think women see me as a cute person to befriend. But not as a sexy attractive man. Ive had self esteem issues throughout my entire life and have just started working on them. Throughout my life i was basically a pushover. Only in the past few months ive been trying to change that. \n\nAnd as importantly as the other points i made, i cant find any girl im attracted to in the first place. Throughout my entire high school life, i never felt romantic attraction to anyone. I didnt really want to date with anyone. I just couldnt find someone to have a relationship with. All the girls were either too mentally unstable, not my type, too dumb or were just not attractive to me. And i dont really like the idea of having sex with someone im not romantically attracted to. \n\n\nThe problems that ive been able to identify with myself have been, \n1) Im not attractive\n2) I dont know how to flirt with women\n3) I cant find a women that i want in the first place\n\nI dont know how all of these problems can be solved. Most people already live the important milestones in their life that makes them naturally develop these skills. These skills that are just innate to people, never came to me naturally. \n\nI dont know what to do or how to solve this. I dont know if it will ever get better. I just want to be happy with a loving gf and a healthy, satisfying sex life. Is that too much to ask? Can i improve myself on these issues? If so, how? Can i ever have a gf or can i ever have sex in the future?",

I feel that I am in a vicious cycle of over-thinking, but i feel so compelled to believe that I need to do better and meet expectations for myself and everyone else. This is all because I know that if i dont, I know the regret I will feel after. Why are we made so flawed, I dont get it. I wish to just be stripped of my consciousness because my personal consciousness feels like hell on earth. I honestly can't even put my persistent thoughts into words because its all one blurry cloud that just eats at me. I hate myself so much... so fucking much. Sad part is that it doesnt feel like the kind of self-hate that induces the personal changes that I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, rather it just eats at me and causes me to hate myself to the point where I dont feel like I deserve that supposed \"better self\".

    "text": "Since I was a kid I was easy going, and chill since a baby I hardly ever cried. I had a difficult mom and alcoholic dad but they were able to provide.\n\nI moved around alot and always struggled to fit in. As a youth I wanted to fit in. I was always different from my peers in race, religion etc. I was also considered gifted and taught myself how to read around 3-4 yrs. I had a bright future but it means nothing now:\n\nI remember as a little kid I was on a soccer team but I could never make it to practice even though I loved it and was driven to score at least one goal (me and my friend had a brt who would score first) I would wake up on Saturday morning to go to practice dressed and ready to go but every week my mom would work and my dad would drink. I asked to go with my friends mom but my mom didnt like her.\n\nFrom this time forward I discovered online gaming and porn. I was about 8. At this point I moved to another state and went to an all white school where I was different again. By this time I was a little chubbier and kind of gave up on sports. The school I went to was full of rich kids who were in many activities and better than me at all sports.\n\nThey were nice to me when I first moved but they quickly alienated me when they found i wasnt good at sports. Call me all kinds of things and hit me but I didn\u2019t fight back. I went home to my drunk father who beat me for my bad grades and told me \u201cno wonder nobody likes you you\u2019re stupid.\u201d My mom would humiliate me for not being tough enough to stand up for myself and would point at a commercial of a man talking to a therapist whining. And the therapist emasculates him then she would laugh at me and say \u201cthat is you. Get some self confidence\u201d. Eventually all these criticisms followed me to my 27 yrs of age all throyghout bullied by peers and parents without a drop off validation. Not one girlfriend nothing. \n\nOver time my parents matured but I went down a predictable path and now they speak to me and about me in ways that hint that I am not man enough. For example my dad uses euphemisms like stop being too nice\/doormat. Or my mom talking to my little sister about me that she cant rely on me to stand up for her or myself so she would rather take my sister.\n\nI have committed to boxing for 8 yrs and nofap all of that self improvement trying to change my life around. The chasm is too deep. The belief that I\u2019m not man enough is embedded into my being and I don\u2019t think I will ever live a satisfying life.\n\nRecently my mom started crying and apologizing to me idk what made her have an epiphany. I moved out quietly and minimize contact with them and now they want me to forgive them. Even if I forgive them the damage is done. I do forgive them but even being in their presence leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I think that it is more about alleviating her guilt rather than for me. She kind of force\/demands\/begs for forgiveness. I said I do but why should I live with the pain forever and alleviate your guilt. If I cut your arms off and beg you to forgive me no amount of begging will help it. It\u2019s too late to care now. They pressure me to get married and talk about it as if I was a meek loser who they have sympathy for. The same mother who told me \u201cyou will never find a girl because you\u2019re too much of a pushover you are a wuss\u201d. Opened my mind up to register that same hurt from my male peers and girls.\n\nI was boxing for 8 yrs seriously while studying\/working but I feel behind socially too the point material things don\u2019t matter anymore. I know deep in my heart that the reason those words and actions hurt so much is because it\u2019s true. I will never have my pick of women or even a relationship because of this compounding pain and time going by. I will never be connected to a community or my peers and at this point I can\u2019t even want those things. I am stuck and want milestones that teenagers have been done c with long ago. When ai have a girlfriend\/wife now it\u2019s like \u201caww he\u2019s a late bloomer\u201d I hate that Shit and I shouldn\u2019t have to explain why. If I see a bully today and beat him down in public now Im an immature loser monster. But if I was younger it would be like he\u2019s a tough guy and would\u2019ve helped my self esteem. Now I am trying to let go of the opinions of other ppl. They would never understand why I would do that but it doesn\u2019t matter. Maybe if I do it and deal with whatever consequences I will finally have inner peace.\n\nI feel like my life was conquered and stamped into the dust by other people before I had a chance. There\u2019s no point to this thread just reflecting out loud. I don\u2019t want to kill myself but I am scared of being 30 with what I am and aging with more regrets compounding. I\u2019m at the end of the rope so I thought I\u2019d share here. I can\u2019t look myself in the Mirror and settle for less because the constant noise and doubt in my head paralyzed me. I can\u2019t see past it and numb myself with substances now because then at least I can be minimally productive and survive till my next sleep. I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it because they reinforced the idea that I am a wuss crying about words said in the past. Maybe, but I know that\u2019s where everything stems from.\n\nI just need to tell someone some of it so I wrote it here",

I finally said that out loud today to Brandon and I felt like such an idiot saying it. I know that having emotions and feelings is totally fine, but I was also raised in a more old school mindset and am concerned about how people will react or feel when I truly open up to them. \n\nI tell everybody, including myself, that I\u2019m fine and I\u2019m doing great, but truly I\u2019m barely surviving. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore, I don\u2019t know what I want, I don\u2019t know what I desire or urn for. I feel like no one knows me. I feel like my life is completely different than how anyone sees me. I feel like a duck on a lake, floating and calm at the surface, but underneath I\u2019m frantically trying to keep myself above water and alive.\n\nI love my family my friends and my life, but I can\u2019t seem to love myself. I wish I was enough, I wish I felt like I was enough, but I haven\u2019t felt like that in so long I don\u2019t even remember what it feels like. \n\nI won\u2019t give up on myself and the life everyone expects out of me, but I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of feeling unworthy, I\u2019m tired of criticizing myself, I\u2019m tired of second guessing the decisions I make, I\u2019m tired of thinking I need to be, or change\/become better to deserve love and appreciation.\n\nRecently I lost a year with sam-my dog(in my head due to poor math) Sam is my reason for being here still, I don\u2019t want to let my family or friends down, but Sam relies on me for his life and I can\u2019t take that from him. For now I\u2019m taking everything one step at a time, day by day, but I know that soon, my main man, my source of peace and solitude will leave me. I don\u2019t know if I can handle that. \n\nI can barely handle my ex leaving me, someone I loved that couldn\u2019t love me back. I promise I\u2019m trying and I will continue trying for as long as I can, but please know. If you\u2019re reading this and I\u2019m gone;\n\nI love you with all my heart, no one other than the people closest and dearest to me will be able to see this and I want you to know that this had nothing to do with you or how I was treated. I was put in this earth with quite a few underlying problems, while I worked on dealing with them, sometimes they win. I hope they don\u2019t win overall and take me from the people I love",

I think I\u2019ve accepted the fact that if I ever follow through, I\u2019ll be okay with it. I\u2019m only 23 and I fully feel as if I\u2019ve lived enough for me to able to leave and feel like I\u2019ve left nothing behind. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve grown numb to my emotions or if I\u2019m really just on the verge of leaving it all behind.

Idk if it\u2019s truly selfish for not wanting to exist but I do know that I have finally cracked under the pressure. Everything I put my efforts in feel like nothing anymore, the feeling of wanting to be cared for died long ago, and the thought of just not being around anymore truly feels like the most comforting feeling. Last year on New Years, I had a conversation with myself while experiencing the ego death from shrooms and I said that 2023 was going to be the difference making year. I did have my accomplishments but I realize that the lows only got heavier and heavier. I learned acceptance through heartbreak, I busted my ass to feel the best at what I do to have it ripped away from me in order to follow my heart, and I learned that the people who will stab you in the back wear the biggest smiles. So I leave this here to see if my 2024 will be worth it, if not I believe it will be my sign to leave this all behind and not having a second thought about it.",

I should end my life, I haven't felt anything good since I'm a child and my life since I became 12 years old went for the worst.\n\nAny type of help I received was futile or useless at the end, antidepressants, pills for concentration since I can't even do that right (I overdosed with one of them once, was kind of funny since I though I would puke my guts or something similar to that), therapy. It's useless at the end, I keep waiting and waiting, trying to change my life to see if it's getting any better at the end, unfortunately it doesn't. The worst thing is that, I'm in my early 20s now, this time should be the best time I'll ever have in my entire life, or at least that's why therapists and other people in my small circle tell me.

    "title": "A lot of anti-bullying campaigns only talk about \"emotional support\" for victims and not enough about confronting bullies.",
    "text": "A lot of these commercials are very soft. Some of them aren't even about bullying. I remember seeing one about including a person if they seem lonely and then they equated that to bullying as if it's a kid's responsibility to befriend someone. While inclusion is good, that isn't always the solution people want. Some kids, as I have had to learn over the years, will get annoyed if you try to approach them and actually want to be alone. But what bothers me more about these anti-bullying commercials is the way these people are talking about how to handle a situation with bullying. Instead of the idea of confronting a bully if you see it happen, they're talking about supporting the victim afterwards. This non-confrontational solution doesn't do anything. Imagine being bullied whether it's teasing, harassment, or getting beaten up and someone says \"Hey, I saw what happened to you. Are you okay?\" over and over each time it happens instead of actually doing something. A bully doesn't stop bullying simply because they see that their victim has friends. Telling a teacher, assistant principal, principal, or counselor  sometimes works as  adults might do something or unfortunately not do anything. But I can't imagine seeing someone get punked, beaten up, teased, cursed at, and having slurs yelled at them and do nothing until after it's done and then ask the victim if they're okay. Why the fuck would they be? Would I be okay if people just sat there while I'm being teased or beaten up? No. So why are these new commercials about anti-bullying about being passive and not active? A lot of people complain about kids being softer than the prior generations, but it is the prior generations that teach these kids to be soft, which is very ironic. ",

    "text": "So this all started a month ago when my mother found one of the sex toys that I had in my closet. My dad told me to hide them because we were having guests over so I did and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Tonight I learned that they went through ALL of my drawers and found all of my sex toys.\n\nFor reference, I do have a collection of sex toys. They make the primordial sex driven part of my caveman brain happy and do fill me with a bit of a sense of joy when I see them (don\u2019t even have to use them to experience joy).\n\nThey think what I have is excessive, and hearing that really hurt me. It made me feel like a complete freak and a disappointment. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just venting because I\u2019m mad at myself for expecting privacy in my own home when I maybe should have moved out by now (I\u2019m 24 and finished up college in May). I\u2019m mad that I\u2019m not better with finances and haven\u2019t had any motivation to find some place, and I\u2019m mad that my stupid desire to even have sex toys put me in this situation in the first place.\n\nMy parents have been on my ass about stuff the past few months and one of these times I\u2019m going to blow up and just ask them if I\u2019m a disappointment to them or something like that. Doing this guessing game of assuming I am is hurting, if I\u2019m a disappointment, I just wanna know it and move on with my life.\n\nI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to try and improve my situation by trying to learn how to suppress the urge to buy stuff (which includes sex toys and also will allow me to get a good amount of money saved up) so I can find a place and move out and not have to deal with them anymore. \n\nI\u2019m still just mad at myself for being such a degenerate. I\u2019m just hoping I can turn my life around.",

    "text": "If I look around me I am getting more and more the impression that our society (speaking about the western world) is slowly but surely getting corrupted. Cost of living is raising everywhere, while inflation gives us even less purchasing power. Where I live I have the feeling that they are trying to rip off the ordinary citizen from top to bottom, be it in shopping, restaurants, the real estate market, etc. When I talk to people the first question I get asked is where did I work and where did I study. It feels all so superficial and unnatural that I have a hard time coping with it. People describe themself as a wage slave because they basically just work in order to survive and thats it. \n\nIn terms of dating people talking about \"hoeflation\", work harder to get a less desirable women. I have the impression that if you are a decent guy (looks wise and personality wise) you are disadvantaged. I dont know if its my childish heart that tells me, that if you are a beautiful person you will attract someone beautiful but the last 2 years I made the experience this is just not the case. If you cant provide some form of status or money your chances are just low. I dont know how it was 20 years ago but I watched as young buy American Pie 2 (The Movie) and thought the real life will be later the same. I am aware that its just a movie but at the end its just about having a good time with friends, family and chicks without being the next Apple CEO.\n\nSometimes I feel like a product that is completely milked dry and doesn't even derive any form of personal benefit from it. Whats the point of our current lifestyle? Is it at the end not just about having a good time with people? As the title suggests, I think nowadays its just about money, status and women. The rest does not count. \n\nGuys, what do you think?",

    "text": "Excuse how long this thread is but this is the first time I\u2019m using this app as a safe space to let out some things that have been on my mind for a while. I\u2019m currently a Computer Science major at a University, and the journey has been rocky since I\u2019ve gotten into school. From meeting other students, being exposed to the very things College has to offer, dating, and working part time as a full time student, it has been more and more of a hassle to maintain anything. \n\nI joined the Army straight out of high school. Later joining rotc and being kicked out 2 years later for not attending class and workout sessions. Then I got involved in a situation that resulted me into going to jail (2020), losing my $30k scholarship with rotc. (The start of my absence. I reached my Senior year last Fall (2022) and back to back semesters then and Spring \u201823, I started noticing how much I missed classes. Eventually I fell so far behind in my classes I ultimately stopped going. I felt like I wasn\u2019t smart enough to continue. Summer 2023 I scheduled 2 classes just to attempt to pick up my GPA and felt great about it, only to come into this Semester (Fall \u201823) and repeated the cycle. \n\nI have a passion in photography and started my own business within the start of my college career, and I find myself taking graduation pictures for others I grew close with, and once graduation was over & they got their pictures, I never heard from them again. Friends, even back to back girlfriends. I\u2019ve watched my brother, close friends \/ associates graduate and truly advance in their lives, meanwhile I feel as though I\u2019m not able to achieve my own dreams as much as others have. They\u2019re venturing off with internships, finding someone to call their own in relationships, getting great jobs, new cars, whatever. Just advancing as a whole, and I\u2019m going on my 2nd year of doubt. I pray so much but for some reason I just can\u2019t seem to shake this uncertainty with myself that \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll always be stuck\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never make it further than what I am now\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have to settle\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll always be alone\u201d etc etc. idk man. \n\nI stopped going places if I wasn\u2019t working or being paid to take photos. Even at my own job I feel like I\u2019m being cheated. Everyone\u2019s getting pay raises left and right, but when I ask it\u2019s always a run around. \u201cYou\u2019re worth more than what work here\u201d yet nothing. Just stalling. I asked again months later and I got \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask again in a few weeks.\u201d Like okay. So I\u2019m contemplating on quitting, but before I do I\u2019d like to find a better job. \n\nIdk what to do. I can\u2019t talk to my folks about my issues, they claim depression as me being in my feelings and I need to grow up and get over this. I can see where they\u2019re coming from, but I\u2019ve resulted to isolating myself from everyone. Only coming out when I solely need to, meeting people coincidentally. I\u2019ve tried therapy before, and it worked, but my sessions conflicted with work, so I stopped going. After getting out of jail, 2020-2022 I was fumbling jobs left and right, just not able to maintain a job. Some jobs I held for a month, others 2 weeks, then I stayed for 6 months and all of a sudden I\u2019d get fired or just wouldn\u2019t show up to work. Why? Idk. I really couldn\u2019t tell you. \n\nThen, there\u2019s my love life. I\u2019m a hopeless romantic, always going above and beyond for others when they couldn\u2019t care less about me, or not putting as much effort as I am. Seemingly one sided. Then I\u2019ve been lead on various times where I\u2019m thought to believe they want something with me as their efforts, words, and intentions were genuine and not something someone does or says to someone they jus like \u201cas a friend\u201d then after a couple months of getting to know then, DATES, sleeping with or even sleeping over by each others houses, meeting parents, it always ends as \u201cI really just like being around you as a friend. No more no less.\u201d\nSo there\u2019s that too. I\u2019ve gotten it into my mind that I won\u2019t find anyone that\u2019s truly for me, and I\u2019ll have to settle. I have girls who throw themselves at me in various ways, offering to take me out, giving me their number, complimenting me, calling and texting me, even getting people who are close to me to talk to me about responding to their messages and calls. BUT, I just don\u2019t know who\u2019s genuine and who\u2019s not, resulting me to say to hell with relationships and getting to know others. I\u2019ve been single all 2023 and it\u2019s almost over so I\u2019m keeping my word on that, yet I feel so alone. \n\nI\u2019m 24 years old now and feel hopeless on love, school, and life as a whole. I\u2019ve been thinking about trying to deploy with my unit overseas for a year or two to escape my civilian life. Though I\u2019ve watched how much that has affected some of those who have been in the same position I\u2019m in, and some greats things came out of it, but once they got back, it seemed as though the world had forgotten about them and people, and family was forced to live without them. Ultimately resulting the soldier to lose connection with others and put themselves to in even more of a isolated position in the end. I just don\u2019t know anymore. I will say I can\u2019t come to terms with ending my life as I\u2019ve had a very close friend of mine commit \u2018sewerslide\u2019 2 months before graduating high school. I know how it affects others as it affected me tremendously, so that\u2019s not an option. But omg.\n\nI. Just. Feel. Stuck. With. No. True. Faith. In. Myself.",

Then I became more agitated, more violent, started to lash out at those around me, changed my job many times, spent 1 month in jail for aggravated assault and battery, was put on probation, made suicide plans, approached 7 times, attempted 2 times. Decided to see a psychiatrist, after 5 visits heard diagnosis: borderline personality disorder. \n\nStarted medication, not really feeling better, but I'm no longer punching people for mere looks. \n\nStarted therapy, wasn't feeling it, dropped therapy. \n\nDecided to try and find a support group. There's around 30 groups for people whose closest one has BPD, in 100 km area. 4 support groups those who suffer from it. \n\nDecided to call all four of them, and they all are only for women. One of the groups representative even said that I shouldn't joke about it and to not call ever again. \n\nTried some of the subreddits, but their problems seem so trivial to me I can't stand reading it.\n\n(Not to invalidate theirs experiences, but it's hard to find a connection with these people)\n\nI don't know what to do, I feel like I need to share my thoughts with someone who's suffering as I do. \n\nI don't want to burden my fiancee with the contents of my head, sometimes I can't focus on work because the thoughts are too loud, thinking is done too fast, can't catch it all.

My hobbies are no longer interesting, things that once brought me joy now just burn the time until it's bed o'clock. Can't fall asleep, unable to wake up, wanting to change something, not being strong enough to actually push through with it.

I have been dealing with shitty people who can't do their jobs though, so I haven't really been in a social mood.\n\nI thought a lot about the girl I like.

I don\u2019t even want to go past 30, that\u2019s too much life. I don\u2019t want a wife. I don\u2019t want kids. That\u2019s too much of a sign on to life. It means people will depend on me being around, which is something I don\u2019t want to do. Even moreso, it\u2019s not something I can guarantee I\u2019ll do. \n\nI don\u2019t see myself as sick, I feel more so that I don\u2019t see past the base level truths of life. Nothing means anything. Everything is pointless. No it doesn\u2019t mean you should enjoy what time you have, because it doesn\u2019t matter anyways. If you lived the greatest life someone could ever live, does it matter? Even if for generations past you, the world is positively affected by your actions. Does it matter? My thinking is no. The earth and universe will implode one day and on that day everything  that had been will cease to have meaning. That means it never really did. I understand I\u2019m morbidly pessimistic but is that wrong? When the flip side is to just act like all that doesn\u2019t matter? To act like everyday is worth living just because I swam to a egg? I can\u2019t even swim in real life lmao\n\nI\u2019m not religious but if there\u2019s something out there, I pray almost everyday that it kills me dead. Idc about how, just that it happens. I\u2019ve wished for it all, car to hit me, someone rob and kill me, give me brain cancer, end it while I\u2019m sleeping. \n\nI\u2019ve had good things happen in my life but I can\u2019t see past the shade. I\u2019m not some dark soul who broods and cuts himself over this(though I absolutely get physical in my panic attacks). I\u2019m a very like able, friendly, cheerful, genuine person who many people enjoy being around when I\u2019m able to hide my truths. When I can\u2019t, I stick to myself and yeah I have a down period where I want to fuck off the face of the earth because if I don\u2019t? I\u2019d have killed myself years ago. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not some rube who intakes too much social media to the point that I\u2019m affected by dumb shit. I couldn\u2019t care less about the anti men shit, or the stigmas, or the \u2018what about our side!\u2019.

It may get heightened in these times but overall I\u2019m always feeling like I shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable here. The downtimes I feel just show me that more. Sure, emotion and consciousness and life are beautiful, miraculous things. And I think there is so much beauty in life and in the world and universe. So much we don\u2019t understand which is incredible to feel lost in that and another point of beauty.

I still live with my parents and my father watches military movies very loud all the time, I asked him what\u2019s the appeal of military movies and he told me war is in our blood as males, and we were meant to fight in wars & war is sometimes good which made me a little sad hearing that from a parent. While i believe fighting in tiny nomadic groups and hunting animals is in our nature, i don\u2019t think we are meant to die in organized meat grinder war.

Slowly, I've started to make improvements in my life. It's been a gradual change but a much needed one. I'm happy to say that in my 40's I'm in a happier place then ever before. Or at least I thought I was...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been bullied for so long I developed Social Anxiety and low self confidence. Again, I've slowly improved over the years, and even kissed a girl for the first time at 38, something I never thought would happen in my lifetime. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently have a woman in my life who I love dearly. When I'm with her my Social Anxiety is just gone, and I know that she'll accept me just as I am. She's the only person I've ever felt that way with. Her and I aren't dating (she's just done with dating after dealing with her own shit) and I can respect that. I'm a little disappointed sure but I still love her, and I still get to spend time with her, and while I have no expectation that it'll happen, people change their minds all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm happier than I've ever been. Yet I feel so lonely and depressed lately like nothing has changed. It's just so frustrating and confusing. I thought I was getting better, so why do I feel worse? I just feel so helpless and I hate feeling this way when by all accounts I am better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just keep coming back to that. I'm in a better place, so why am I sad? I just can't come up with anything. I'm hoping by writing it all out I can start to heal a bit. I'd love to hear your thoughts though.",

    "title": "Me being a man wanting a relationship is just pathetic",
    "text": "Recently, I realized this is probably why I feel so bad about myself and feel like I'm wrong for what I want: because it conflicts with things I've learned and been taught growing up. Like growing up, it was like I was taught that men should be the providers all the time and women the receivers. A man needs to put in all the work towards a relationship, such as initiating things, carrying conversations, and doing nice things while all a woman needs to do is just sit back and exist. She can have all the standards she wants but all a man should have is only 'female' and\/or 'Catholic,'(I'm Catholic myself) nothing more. If a man cares about looks at all, then he's just shallow because 'looks don't matter' and as they say, they fade really fast once you get married to them. For even starting one, men must always be the pursuers and women just need to be there and choose. Only men need to work on themselves and change, while women can sit back and just be themselves, not even thinking about what she should do for her man the same way he thinks of her. If a woman wants a relationship, it's okay because she'll get that, but for a man to desire one, it just comes off as pathetic. If a man wants something out of a relationship, well, as they say, \"Happy wife, happy life.\" For who someone should marry, parents have a good idea as to what makes good partners for their children. And if a woman wants lots and lots of children, then a man just needs to play along as that's what marriage is all about: having as many kids as you can. \n\nYet that's not me at all. I want someone who I find beautiful to put just as much effort as I would loving her and it's someone I ACTUALLY want. Like, it even feels emasculating that as a man, I want love, affection (definitely hugs and cuddles), someone to do nice things for me, initiate conversations, listen to me when I want to talk about something I enjoy or want to vent about, participate in activities I enjoy, let me be emotional and cry in her lap, and even pay for dates every now and then. Is there even a woman who really wants a man like me and maybe even now despite not knowing me, has the same pain in her heart because she wants to be with someone like me? Because from everything it seems, it's like women just say they don't need a relationship at all, as they have their friends, lives are better without evil men like me, and if they want kids, they can easily go to a sperm bank because they really only need mothers. So for a man like me to want one like I described? It's just pathetic and revolting",

    "title": "I've accepted solitude",
    "text": "A few weeks ago I made a post talking about being torn between wanting a relationship and wanting to stay single. I think I'm finally starting to accept being in solitude, for the next few years at least. It's a strange sensation. I don't indulge as frequently in self - destructive spirals of scrolling posts about being lonely. I no longer put myself through the sludge of dating apps. I no longer desperately approach women on nights out. I no longer question what's wrong with me, I just live in attempting to accept and love myself as much as I can. In a way, life has made it easy for me. There is no one in my vicinity who I'm interested in. No friends, no colleagues, not an acquaintance or a pretty stranger who works at the bar. Nobody. Nobody hits on me or displays any interest and I don't do it to anyone else either. The world is simply a collection of talking mannequins, save for a few friends of mine. Whatever life exists in memories behind their eyes is none of my business, and they care just as little for mine. A life which is beginning to feel more and more like a dream than something that happened. My sensations are dulled and my sense of self has somewhat dimmed since I was younger. As a result, I've been forced to either swim or drown. I now live life in a form of autopilot. I focus on hoarding as much wealth as I can safe in the knowledge that I will not have a spouse or children to worry about spending it on. It is a completely neutral existence. I am currently studying the Vulgata in Latin and maybe trying to work on a few novels whilst learning about investment and staying fit.\n\nI suppose I'm in a better position than other men because I had the experiences they crave in my early twenties, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, more that doors in my life are closing and I have to learn to adapt. The reason why I'm posting this is because I see it as development that I no longer engage in death spirals of self hatred and worry over this issue. I used to fall into pits of despair every single day at being single, the last time I did was two weeks ago. I've learned, I suppose, that it is an absolutely pointless thing to worry about. My whole life I've wondered if I was doing the right thing to impress women. Saying the right thing, being funny enough. I couldn't care less now. In a way, I feel like they've always needed me to be someone different. I honestly wish I had learned this mindset earlier, it would've made me much happier and saved me a lot of traumatic experiences trying to be with people who weren't right for me. I'm not going to deny that perhaps at the core, there's a lot of pain. A lot of frustration and disappointment. Would I have wanted things to be different? Maybe. But you'll never know if the person you're with is the right person. At least alone, there's security.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "I have a complicated relationship with being black. On one hand I do love myself and wouldn\u2019t want to be anyone else, but on the other, I can\u2019t help but think of myself as someone who doesn\u2019t belong. Trash. Garbage. \n\nAs a child, I hated being black because of expectations from others. I love to draw cute OCs, collect figurines, and basically nerd out about topics I love. But that clashes with the expectations that people wanted from me so eventually I learned to hide what I liked to do and pretended to be into whatever others were into. None of those interests were traditionally masculine, so subconsciously I tried to be accepted. But of course this never worked out and for most of my childhood I was alone.\n\nEventually I began self hating myself. Hating blackness in general. I like to think that I\u2019ve grown from that point of my life, but still at 28 now, I have those thoughts about myself. \u201cOh, if only I was this and that people would like!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a tall bulky looking black male and sometimes I feel like a piece of shit. I walk down the street and say hi to people passing by and some just give me this weird look like they\u2019re afraid of me. I try to be a good person to everyone I meet mostly because I don\u2019t want people to be afraid of me. Then there\u2019s rejection from employers and I always wonder if it\u2019s because of what I look like?\n\nThen there\u2019s the dating which I feel I should give up on. Either I get no responses from women on dating apps or I just get hit up as a fetish. I feel like maybe it\u2019s because of my face? Or my personality? Maybe they\u2019re not looking for black men with weird introverted hobbies? I never really had any real success in the dating world. \n\nSometimes I feel I don\u2019t belong anywhere. I have lost almost 40 Ibs since the start of the year and have been practicing self love but sometimes it feels like it\u2019s all in vain. Many, many times I thought about giving up life but I can\u2019t because I know there will be people sad if I suddenly quit life.",

    "text": "Hello, I wanted to know if there are other people in my boat. I live alone in a 1  bedroom apartment, where I work from home, and mostly sit on PC. I do not have social skills, nor do I like cleaning or organizing. I can cook for myself, and I do bare minimum cleaning and laundry, but everything is messy. Guys are ok with my apartment, but girls hate it. I feel that's the lifestyle that makes me happy, but I want to be with a woman too, but I know, accept, and understand why many women wouldn't want to be with me. I am still not happy, nor do I see I will be happy if I changed my entire life just to get a partner, so in the end I wish I was never born sometimes because all the options are bad. I do not begrudge women for not wanting someone who lives as me. I am a virgin by the way. The point is am upset at life, cause there is no life style I can be happy with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also feel resentment that women don't need us as much as we need them, because I do not have anything to offer that they want, but I need them to be happy. Again this does not lead me to hating women, or wanting their rights going away, just it makes me feel life doesn't have the components I need for me to be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also read a lot of women saying that men don't actually like women but want to use them, but the way I feel is I cannot even afford to think whether I like a woman or not because I need them. Like there isn't a good way to give this example, but let's say there is one police man and you liked him but there is a criminal nearby, if you liked him you wouldn't want him to go in danger to fight the criminal, but because your need of him triumpths you liking him, then you want to use him first.",

    "text": "\r  \nI was seven years old. \r  \n\r  \nMy parents were in the process of splitting up, and it was having a substantial affect on my psyche. \r  \n\r  \nI used to explain: \"I feel like an apple that's had a bite taken out of it\". Subsequently, my parents took me to a therapist. \r  \n\r  \nWe used to take walks and I would talk to him about things I was interested in, it was extremely validating to me. I felt recognized, I felt like someone cared about me. \r  \n\r  \nGradually, I stopped seeing him at the age of around 9. \r  \n\r  \nThings got worse at home, as my mom and my dad lived far away from each other, and each had other things on their mind. \r  \n\r  \nI would spend every other weekend with my dad in the school year, and every other week in the summer. \r  \n\r  \nI felt that no one was paying attention to me, and I felt lonely besides my interactions with kids on Violet Avenue. \r  \n\r  \nAt school, I had friends, and we were somewhat of an outcast group. \r  \n\r  \nBy this point, I was in 5th grade, and my self harm had really set in. \r  \n\r  \nI had started all the way back in third grade, but in this year it became far more common. \r  \n\r  \nIt was mostly related to school; when I felt I wasn't doing well I would hit myself on the head over and over again. \r  \n\r  \nI don't remember if it was for attention, or if I felt I truly deserved it. Probably both. \r  \n\r  \nRegardless, 5th grade was the year I decided to take my own life. I was 10 years old.\r  \n\r  \nI ran into a ditch in the school playground when no one was around and tried to break my head open with rocks. I was too weak. \r  \n\r  \nI told my teacher what I had just tried to do, ashamed. \r  \n\r  \nShe was very concerned and they scheduled an appointment with my parents about my mental health. \r  \n\r  \nThe principal, Mr. Atwood, sat us down in the main office and spoke with us about sending me to some kind of facility for suicidal children, but my parents refused. \r  \n\r  \nIn 6th grade, I was still hurting myself regularly. It was a coping mechanism. \r  \n\r  \nIn this year, I got accepted into ER classes, which is the Enrichment Program, a program for exceptional children. \r  \n\r  \nMy mental health still worsened as I was deeply afraid of leaving the elementary school, of growing up. \r  \n\r  \nI was still trying to process my life and I had growing feelings of worthlessness. \r  \n\r  \nI then entered Middle School. \r  \n\r  \nIt felt soulless. I felt as though the best times of my life were over, in spite of how my childhood actually was; unhappy.\r  \n\r  \nOur school split groups of students into \"teams\", where they would be isolated for all of their classes and activities. \r  \n\r  \nSo, I had to resort to contacting most of my friends via Google Docs and Microsoft Teams. We made group chats.\r  \n\r  \nI still made new friends, but I was even deeper into the outcast groups. \r  \n\r  \nI was trying so hard in school that I had 100s in all of my classes. \r  \n\r  \nAnd then, COVID-19 happened in late 2019, 7th grade.\r  \n\r  \nI was still in the aftermath of my attempted suicide at this point, and to have all of this time to myself was the most introspective I had been up to that point.\r  \n\r  \nIt destroyed me. \r  \n\r  \nI continued to break down, I continued to harm myself. It became the norm. \r  \n\r  \nCalling my friends on Microsoft Teams was the only contact I had with anybody outside of my family, who were growing tired with my actions.\r  \n\r  \nI became deeply invested in Christianity, perhaps as an apology for my 5th grade belief in Buddhism.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, in spite of the mental decline I experienced, I think Quarantine helped me. I realized that my behavior was becoming more and more destructive, and resolved to stop it. \r  \n\r  \nIn 8th grade, I was going to school on a hybrid schedule, meaning I would be at home every other day. Instead of my usual hitting myself, I began to hit my desk, and exerted enough self control to not do it in school. I still continued to cry in class, though, which is something I had been doing since 6th grade. \r  \n\r  \nBy 9th grade, all of this stopped. In the summer of 2021, I changed myself, though I don't know how. I decided I didn't want to be the same way I had been most of my life to that point.  \r  \n\r  \nI just decided to \"mellow out\". I stopped crying in class and I started making new friends.\r  \n\r  \nI became somewhat of a class clown, but was still deeply unhappy. \r  \n\r  \nIt wasn't until late last summer that my view of the world began to improve to some extent. \r  \n\r  \nI am happier than I ever have been, and I think that there's only up, though sometimes my mental issues reappear.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am 16 years old, and I haven't told anyone the above about my life in a 100% truthful manner. \r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading.

I didn't want to be in a relationship because I didn't want my partner to have a difficult time. I learned to not act on any attraction. \n\nI didn't have a crush in a while. Something I really miss. Last year I became friends with some new people. One girl stood out to me. Before I could act, she got into a relationship with another mutual friend. I was not hung over her but I was jealous of the relationship. They are broken up and still I am reluctant to pursue her. She's an amazing person and a friend. But she's not the person I fell in love with.\n\nThis year I started a new role where I had to closely work with someone for almost 5 months. She was engaged and I didn't really have a lot of common things with her. I was trying to be a good friend after we were assigned this project. We went through tough times together and she was a great partner and I did my fair share. She saw me. She noticed me and stood up for me at times. For someone with self confidence issues, that was a great thing. At one point, we had a conversation where I learned that we're work friends not friends.  After our project was done she moved to a different state as she was getting married. I didn't want to think about it too much. \n\nI have recently realized that I was avoiding my feelings. I miss her. I miss seeing her everyday. She was never giving any mixed signals. This morning I woke up feeling a 'pain' thinking about her. Something I realized recently was that I was avoiding meeting people interested in me because I was subconsciously faithful. I harbor no resentment but this is my first heartbreak. I will not lose my way. I learned to love myself so much that I will not let this impact me. I just needed to say this out.\n\nIt was doomed to begin with. I need to learn how to love others who are available now lol.",

    "text": "We, men have high sex drives since the time our teenage years start. We'd do anything to have that desire fulfilled in our adolescent years. At least that's my experience.\n\nThe drive is there and it promises some superhuman experience and you always hope you'll get lots of that. Despite that you rarely get to fulfill it. If you do, you're guaranteed to make a lot of compromises. Doesn't matter if your gf has a headache or you have a falling out and doesn't want to have sex with you, the drive is there. \n\nI think it's safe to say that most of us guys don't have all the sex we want in our lives. Unless you're Genghis Khan or Brad Pitt, you don't get to get laid with about anyone you want to. You have a good chance you'll end up with someone who's not really your dream type, or even a good match for you. You don't get to choose. You want someone, but you should be your best self in order to be attractive to her, but people are mostly not their best selves. It's hard to achieve it, and it's very hard, when you're at a disadvantage because of how you were born or raised.\n\nI grew up with a crazy craving desire, which traces back to my childhood. My sexual awakening was not as usual, but I wouldn't want to go into details. I only recently thought about how it's not finding a partner this is about, it's about my desires. I have not the patience to go through the hell of finding someone on a market where guys have generally bad odds. My desires are not a source of pleasure. They are slowly killing me because I have no person to act them out with. They are their own personality with their own needs. I cannot help that.\n\nOf course, this comes off as neediness and scares people, no matter how much I hide it. It somehow shines through I guess.\n\nYou might be among the few (?) who get enough sex. If you do, consider yourself lucky. I have had very little sex in my life and I want to give up on everything because everything seems pointless if I cannot experience heaven on earth. This is my childhood imprint, the essence of my being that I fantasize about every day (I'm not talking about conventional sex here, but that's not the point. Role plays and kinks are more than sex. Imho they are a transformative experience, they complete your personality, they help you become, who you are).   \n\n\nI don't blame girls for this. I'm just saying that this looks very bleak to me and even if I found someone, the bitterness wouldn't go away. Nobody will give me back my lost time and my personality is scarred, no matter what happens in the future.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that? ",

Every time you think you're finally getting a break you get fucked some other way and people just gaslight you and tell you it's your fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI finally had a mental breakdown and quit my job at amazon last year around this time of the year. Before that I worked at that fucking place for 4 years (while working a second job for one of those years AND going to school full time) being talked down to, destroying my spine and feet doing 10hr shifts just to get paid and immediately hand over my paycheck to some fucking company for an overpriced bill or late fee. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven when I was working I had to take out payday loans just to pay my outrageous car insurance and I still had my mom gaslighting me telling that I don't work hard enough and, \"WaStE My MoNeY.\" Despite never going out and still only eating once a day with coupons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver since then I've been trying to finish college and just make it through the year but I lost my car insurance because I couldn't afford to pay it anymore a few months ago, my license is suspended so I can't work anymore, and if I don't come up with roughly $100 I lose my car I busted my ass to get next week as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere comes my Boomer mom telling me it's my fault because the 60hrs a week I put in at Uber isn't enough and I \"WaStE My MonEy\" eating once a day and \\*checks notes putting gas in the car to even work in the first place. She then proceeds to write me a bitch ass email telling me I'm, \"LaZy\" and \"FrEeLoAding\" for not being able to pay my sister rent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of apologizing for not being able to afford $2k+ rent or a $500,000+ house in the land of part-time, minimum wage jobs that don't even want to hire you in the middle of fucking inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of being called lazy despite filling out dozens of applications only to be told \"no\" or never hear anything back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of being told it's my fault all the jobs are shitty part time fast food jobs that I can't work because of school and my spine. Endlessly scrolling job openings only to see a dozen copy and pasted listings for Uber and Lyft WHICH IS WHAT I WAS ALREADY DOING AND ONLY MAKING BARELY ENOUGH TO EAT AND BUY GAS TO WORK AGAIN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of apologizing for eating food and being told I should starve myself for some companies profits (not that it would help because what I spend on food would take literal weeks to cover just one bill....not the late fees).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't even afford to go to my fucking college graduation! And I have to constantly listen to someone telling me it's my fault I can't afford to rent a cap and gown for almost $200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;DR: I used to wonder why people would just give up and live in someone's basement playing games all day or k\\*ll themselves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get it now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's the point in working if nothing you do is never enough and you just keep getting fucked? What's the point in living if you can't actually live and you just exist to work mindlessly all day and stress about money? What's the point in living when you have to live with a bunch of fucking assholes because you can't afford to even live by yourself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm at my breaking point.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "I have this weird disconnect in my mind that makes some people just not seem real. Especially the people closest to me like my mom and my grandmother, they just don't feel like they exist sometimes. It's like I'm not actually in my body or my mind. Kind of like I'm living someone else's life, but the entity (me) that is living that person's life doesn't exist either. Like I'm living someone else's life, but I'm also just empty space at the same time. I don't even know how to describe it. I'm a normal person, mostly extroverted, decent amount of friends, etc., but somehow I feel like this. I don't know if it's a side effect of me literally staying in my room at my grandparents house for like a year and a half from the start of Covid through a chunk of 2021, only coming out of my room to eat once a day, laying on the same bed for 23 hours talking to people on Xbox I wasn't supposed to, a sleep schedule that was from like 9am-2pm and repeat, from the ages of like 12-13. I know for a fact that time completely screwed up my mental processes maybe beyond repair, but I don't know if it caused this or if it's just something else. But people, even friends and family, just don't feel real. My mom hurts the most, because she's a single mom and a nurse, she works 4 days a week for me, and loves me more than anything. At the same time she feels like a stranger most of the time, like she doesn't actually exist. This is something I been struggling with for so long and I've made so many mistakes because of it, and it hurts like hell talking about it. I don't know what this is and I've never seen anyone similar, so i don't even know what i'm saying anymore.",

    "text": "Not exactly sure what to do. I (20M) wouldn\u2019t say I feel passively suicidal, but I have been thinking about death more as of late. Maybe more so struggling with thoughts of self-harming again and not having the motivation to do anything of value in life. I haven\u2019t done anything to hurt myself, but the urge is there and it\u2019s feeling more and more tempting. Haven\u2019t self-harmed in almost a year and felt virtually no desire to during that time until now. I don\u2019t want to fall back into a life of instability. I used to have a horrible cutting addiction. I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m doing well for myself and I feel like if I open up about this I could lose a lot of the good things I still have going for me. I also am in a massive amount of medical debt from past mental health issues and other medical things, so not like I can afford much of anything else aside from my current therapist, which I can see monthly at most. I have a usual counseling appointment in a few weeks, but I don\u2019t want to bring this up with my therapist because 1) I have been doing good for so long I don\u2019t want it to look like all the progress I made just suddenly vanished 2) I don\u2019t want to call any concern to myself because I feel like (while he would do everything he could to help) he would pity me and unintentionally make me feel embarrassed for bringing up concerns 3) The chance he might misinterpret what I say and think I want to actively try and kick the can and get me into a world of trouble (and more medical debt). I can\u2019t tell my family because my mother will just pity me and my father will be upset with me and want me to just man up. I can\u2019t ask any of my roommates for support because I can\u2019t have them worrying about me every second I\u2019m around them, I already feel like they know something is up. I can\u2019t tell my family doctor because 1) I can\u2019t really afford the usual appointment right now as it is 2) I don\u2019t want her to prescribe me medication or refer me to some psychiatrist that will make me take something. I had been on a ton of different cocktails of medication in the past and when I stopped taking them all I had never felt better and that is when I first noticed a huge improvement in my mental health\u2014 even my therapist is all for me not using medication. I have been missing classes because I feel physically ill from anxiety and I feel depressed enough that even when I\u2019m not nauseous I have no motivation to get out of bed. I also feel like I physically have no energy to get out of bed, as I haven\u2019t really been eating a lot. I\u2019ve already lost about three pounds in a week. I feel bad because I\u2019m not being very organized around the home and I feel like I\u2019m being cleaned up after and I\u2019m not pulling my weight but I\u2019m too tired to do much of anything useful. I\u2019m eating less from being nauseous and not having an appetite, last week I ate a total of two meals that didn\u2019t get thrown up. I\u2019m eating more now, but my stomach feels uncomfortable when full. At work I feel like I\u2019m not really there half the time, I\u2019m not focused and I miss more things than I should and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll get in trouble for not paying as close attention as I should. I haven\u2019t really done any school work the past few weeks, I\u2019m behind on emails, and I have missed so many classes. I feel like the only reasons I haven\u2019t started self-harming again is 1) I don\u2019t have enough motivation to get out of bed and actually do it 2) If someone found out I would be in a lot of trouble and I\u2019m worried about how easy it would be to get caught 3) I\u2019m aware of what a slippery slope it is and how addictive it can be. Every time something bad or even mildly inconvenient happens to me my immediate thought is \u201cthis wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I was dead,\u201d or, \u201cI should just die and I won\u2019t have to deal with this anymore.\u201d I missed a religious event a few days ago, I had the whole day off but I was so exhausted I slept in until evening and I missed it because I was too tired, and I didn\u2019t want to risk getting nauseous around my friends at dinner and raising any concerns. I feel like everything is unraveling and I am barely keeping it together. Not sure how to go about this. I worry I could lose a lot if anyone found out about this, which would just make things worse.",

    "text": "For starter\u2019s, I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with depression but I was diagnosed with ADHD around 5 years old, and overall is fairly mild in terms of attention span and hyperactivity, but Jesus Christ my mood swings are fucking horrific. \n\nAny single time I get remotely close to someone, I just want them to be there for me and when they aren\u2019t, I just fall the fuck apart mentally. Example being I met a girl online and we\u2019ve been texting, had a really good text session last night and genuinely felt like we were clicking more before we met up. Today, texted this person around the time people finish their jobs to not come off as clingy and text during work hours, just a basic text. It\u2019s been like 5 hours, nothing back whatsoever extremely disappointing after our constant minute to minute texts last night.\n\nI believe my obvious attachment issues stem from lack of family \u201ccommunity\u201d I grew up as an only child with a single mother with a very small family. Making friends was always hard because of not only this, but having that chronic severe stutter. So anytime I made a connection with someone, I cherish it because of how scarce it is for me to make genuine connections. \nAnyway, every time one of these connections goes wrong, particularly romantic ones, because of how hard it is to date nowadays + add a awkward stutter on top of it. And no I don\u2019t care about sex, I\u2019m not an incel, I care more about the relationship aspect more than anything. \n\nThis just makes my mental completely disintegrate into the worst negative thoughts. My main cope has always been >!thinking of the least painful and least fucked up ways to kill myself. !< I should definitely talk to a therapist about this, but don\u2019t have the money nor want to be looked at a certain way by my family. If I get into graduate school I will certainly try to receive help.",
