Some of them aren't even about bullying. I remember seeing one about including a person if they seem lonely and then they equated that to bullying as if it's a kid's responsibility to befriend someone. While inclusion is good, that isn't always the solution people want. Some kids, as I have had to learn over the years, will get annoyed if you try to approach them and actually want to be alone. But what bothers me more about these anti-bullying commercials is the way these people are talking about how to handle a situation with bullying. Instead of the idea of confronting a bully if you see it happen, they're talking about supporting the victim afterwards. This non-confrontational solution doesn't do anything. Imagine being bullied whether it's teasing, harassment, or getting beaten up and someone says \"Hey, I saw what happened to you. Are you okay?\" over and over each time it happens instead of actually doing something. A bully doesn't stop bullying simply because they see that their victim has friends. Telling a teacher, assistant principal, principal, or counselor  sometimes works as  adults might do something or unfortunately not do anything. But I can't imagine seeing someone get punked, beaten up, teased, cursed at, and having slurs yelled at them and do nothing until after it's done and then ask the victim if they're okay. Why the fuck would they be? Would I be okay if people just sat there while I'm being teased or beaten up? No. So why are these new commercials about anti-bullying about being passive and not active? A lot of people complain about kids being softer than the prior generations, but it is the prior generations that teach these kids to be soft, which is very ironic.

I used to be so desperate for love, still am, but I now value my peace. Its a double edged sword. I'm lonely, but I'm at peace. Once you reach your late 20's, it's sort of forces you to learn this.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malementalhealth\/comments\/17cz18m\/being_a_single_accomplished_male_is_a_double\/"},{"title":"My mind is actually killing me atp","text":"I have this weird disconnect in my mind that makes some people just not seem real. Especially the people closest to me like my mom and my grandmother, they just don't feel like they exist sometimes. It's like I'm not actually in my body or my mind. Kind of like I'm living someone else's life, but the entity (me) that is living that person's life doesn't exist either. Like I'm living someone else's life, but I'm also just empty space at the same time. I don't even know how to describe it. I'm a normal person, mostly extroverted, decent amount of friends, etc., but somehow I feel like this. I don't know if it's a side effect of me literally staying in my room at my grandparents house for like a year and a half from the start of Covid through a chunk of 2021, only coming out of my room to eat once a day, laying on the same bed for 23 hours talking to people on Xbox I wasn't supposed to, a sleep schedule that was from like 9am-2pm and repeat, from the ages of like 12-13. I know for a fact that time completely screwed up my mental processes maybe beyond repair, but I don't know if it caused this or if it's just something else. But people, even friends and family, just don't feel real. My mom hurts the most, because she's a single mom and a nurse, she works 4 days a week for me, and loves me more than anything. At the same time she feels like a stranger most of the time, like she doesn't actually exist. This is something I been struggling with for so long and I've made so many mistakes because of it, and it hurts like hell talking about it. I don't know what this is and I've never seen anyone similar, so i don't even know what i'm saying anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malementalhealth\/comments\/174f5o1\/my_mind_is_actually_killing_me_atp\/"},{"title":"I feel nobody wants to see how much I'm trying","text":"I'm (27M) so tired of people comparing me, or telling me I'm not doing well enough for my age, and I honestly don't feel it's true but whether it's my ex or my parents I think they just don't see my hardships. I started my clothing label when I was in my final year of college and took up a job once I graduated I did both at the same time I used to work from 9 am - 10-10:30 pm and after covid I resigned from the job and started completely focusing on my work. I haven't taken any investment or anything from my parents or anyone. I have never done anything with people of my age did. Mostly everything goes to business. \n\nI have a small production house, I have to pay my salary to my master tailor, rent for my office rent for my apartment. Right now I don't have any savings. My mental health has been in crisis for the last year and it has affected my work, to meet every cost I was vacated from my apartment and moved in with my rent (this was my last option). Everyone keeps asking me to get a 9-5 job. if I take a job, whatever hard work I have done for my brand will go to waste and in Indian fashion industry doesn't pay well for a desk job. \n\nRight now I really wanna help myself with my mental wellbeing but all these make it worse.i don't have any friends or gf and right now I'm standing at point where I feel the entire world is trying to fuck me up despite my every effort. I truly believe in myself I can make my label work and there is growth, people love my work.

Recently my anger had started to slowly build over time as more and more obstacles keep getting recklessly thrown at me left and right. This year especially (for anyone that\u2019s read my other posts here) has really tested my fucking patience and sanity. Never ending bullshit after bullshit after fucking bullshit with no sign of a goddamn break.\n\nAt work I feel like I\u2019m one shitty customer away from a potential assault charge. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m almost anticipating someone fuck with me so I can let all these years of anger and problems out. There\u2019s times I just wanna scream in my car and bash the wheel but that would be another problem added to my fucked up car rn. I wish my luck and fate was personified so I can actually fucking hurt it for all the shit I\u2019ve had to go through.\n\nI hate everything and everyone.

It feels like I'm slowly going insane, I'm losing my mind, been having more outbursts than usual and scratching myself more than usual to the point I have marks all over my neck and face, and chest, and elsewhere most days, the sounds people make every fucking day are driving me mad, I can't even look at other people without being so utterly envious I want to immediately stab myself, I can't go into public without getting anxious, I can't show my face, I don't understand how to interact with others, what the fuck does this world want from me, why the fuck did it make me, fuck you. It feels like people just hate me for some fucking reason and are just waiting for each of my unending fuck-ups so they could make fun of me, it feels like I'm constantly spied on, like my thoughts are getting broadcasted and everyone's making fun of me for what a fucking loser I am, like it's my fucking fault, I didn't fucking choose to be born, go fuck yourselves, I fucking hate you, fuck you, go die.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malementalhealth\/comments\/16zsu2s\/sick_of_being_stuck_between_not_wanting_to_live\/"},{"title":"Worst month of my life","text":"(60m,veteran) So this has been the absolute worst month of my life.  My PSA levels have been trending up, so they did a biopsy.   Yeah, I have stage 1 prostate cancer. Gleason 3+3.   But the biopsy itself has screwed up my \"equipment\".   Climaxes just peter out.   Treatment?  We're just gonna monitor it until it moves to stage 2 or 3.  Next, I have two spots removed off my back.  Yep.  Skin cancer.  So I go back in a few weeks for a full body evaluation. \n\nSo where is my support group?  I'm glad you asked.   You see, my wife is fighting stage 4 breast cancer.  Since 2015.  I'm supposed to be her support.  And right now her blood work is all out of whack.  Her scans are clean, but cancer markers are through the roof.  Her oncologist is baffled and concerned.  So we're dealing with that, and get hit with my health issues. \n\nAnd yesterday, after another failed attempt at intimacy,  while discussing the possible reasons, I get told I don't really have cancer, because I'm not going through chemo or radiation  treatment yet.  Really?  SMDH.  FML.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malementalhealth\/comments\/16yu3uj\/worst_month_of_my_life\/"},{"title":"I haven't felt well in years","text":"I am 15 years old and so far my life has been total hell. I have struggled so much through so much trauma and in my thoughts I hide it with seeing my self as an adult in a child's body. I have lived so trashy. I sleep on a damn couch. School is draining my sanity every day.\n\nSo many people tell me I have it easy. So many people think of me as tough. But in reality I am a sensitive child with anger issues. Yeah I do exercise with my father but that doesn't change shit about my life.\n\nI don't know why or how but for some damn fucking reason I have not been sent into a psych ward yet. For some fucking reason I am still in this same fucking house sleeping on that same fucking couch in the same school, in the same routine, in the same sleep cycles, in the same shit.\n\nI would rather be homeless than spend another fucking day in this shithole you call a \"life\". It is not even a life, it's just existence. I just want to smoke a  damn fucking joint and take a fucking break but I have never even touched a single gram of weed in my life. \n\nIf I ever wind up 6 feet deep you can bet it was by my own terms. I am so fucking tired.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malementalhealth\/comments\/16yyyou\/i_havent_felt_well_in_years\/"}]
