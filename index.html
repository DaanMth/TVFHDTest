        <h1>
            Will anyone accept me?
        </h1>
        <p>
            At this point, it's been months of me being alone, and the more time goes on, the more I lose hope that
            there will be someone out there who will love me for all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and that she would
            be someone insanely beautiful to me and very sweet and loving. Like for months, I've just been crying alone
            in my home, feeling depressed that I come home to nothing. I'm afraid no one would even like me because I am
            very awkward around people I am unfamiliar with and aren't good at socializing due to conditions I was born
            with. I find it hard to connect with others and have almost no friends (that sounds like a huge red flag). I
            hate being alone and having no one to share life despite how everyone preaches it's the best thing ever and
            how relationships suck a lot and they're quite miserable being around this person who interferes with your
            fun. I feel so unlovable, and all these things are the things that others have said is unattractive to
            women. I just feel like I'm some emasculated sorry excuse of a man for wanting someone to take care of me,
            shower me with love, take me out, do things to make me happy and laugh, all because they love me more than
            anything. Even just expressing all these makes me sound like some creepy incel and I'm afraid anything I do
            will come off as creepy.
