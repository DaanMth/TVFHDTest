How have y\u2019all worked towards breaking down and rebuilding these narratives in a healthier way?

Today especially was difficult: I tried talking to a couple of girls at pickleball and I was rejected and in one case, I was left with no one to play with because people would rather play with their friends rather than bringing a new person in. Most of my reading this year has been about social skills and I\u2019ve applied those skills. Still, all I know is pain; I\u2019m all too familiar with the phrase, \u201cI have enough friends.\u201d\n\nIf things don\u2019t get better for me next year, I\u2019ll be looking at a permanent solution to my problems. I\u2019m not spending money hand over fist on therapy, clothes, hobbies, etc. to only know pain.",

Unfortunately, during all of it, I got betrayed, slandered and screwed over by my business partner, and ended up leaving the company on not-so-good terms. My depression has slowly recovered, and I'm now figuring out what's next for my career. \n\nDuring my months of depression, I've alieanted many, many friends. My family doesn't really understand what I went through. I'm single, no girlfriend -- partly a factor of focusing all my time on work in the past couple of years. On days like this, I feel extremely lonely. I feel like a failure at 30. I've disappointed many people and myself. I don't know what to do. :(",
